To  run that React + Vite template, you need to:

1. **Have Node.js installed** (v16+ recommended) and npm.
2. **Install dependencies** in your project folder:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

* This will launch Vite with **Hot Module Replacement** (HMR) so your changes appear instantly.




Haven't done for now: 

Optional:

* If using **@vitejs/plugin-react** → Babel handles Fast Refresh.
* If using **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc** → SWC handles Fast Refresh (faster).

You only need one of the plugins installed in `package.json`.
